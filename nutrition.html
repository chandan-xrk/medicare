🔍 Common Nutrition Myths vs. Facts

❌ Myth	✅ Fact
"Carbs make you fat"	Only refined carbs do. Complex carbs like whole grains are essential.
"Skipping meals helps lose weight"	Skipping meals slows metabolism and causes overeating later.
"Fat-free is always healthy"	Many fat-free products have added sugar or chemicals.
"Dieting means eating less"	Good nutrition means eating smart, not eating less.
🌟 Why Regular Nutrition Checkups Matter
✅ Catch nutrient deficiencies early
✅ Reduce risk of lifestyle diseases
✅ Maintain healthy weight
✅ Improve digestion, sleep, and mood
✅ Prevent food-related complications during treatments
✅ Support healing post-surgery or illness

💬 Dietitian Tips from the Medicare Team
🥦 “Don’t starve—swap!”
Swap fried snacks for roasted chana, sugary drinks for infused water.

🍉 “Color your plate.”
Each color in fruits/veggies gives unique vitamins & antioxidants.

🕐 “Timing matters as much as quantity.”
Late-night eating and irregular meals disrupt metabolism.

🍽️ “Eat slow.”
Give your brain 20 minutes to register fullness.
